# My-Chat-Room Webapp

This a ChatRoom where you can invite your friends and have fun with Realtime chat with them...

This is based on Websocket and for implementation of socket I used Socket.io.


## What is Socket.io?

_*Socket.IO*_ is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.
